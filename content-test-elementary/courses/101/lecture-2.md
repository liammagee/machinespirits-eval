### Which Fraction is Bigger?

- Sometimes we need to compare fractions
- Is 1/4 bigger or smaller than 3/4?
- Today we'll learn how to figure this out!

```notes
Now that we know what fractions are, let's learn how to compare them.

This is useful for lots of things! Like if your friend ate 2/8 of a pizza and you ate 3/8, who ate more?

We'll start with the easiest case: when fractions have the same denominator.
```

### Same Denominator = Easy!

When fractions have the **same denominator**, just compare the numerators!

- **3/4** vs **1/4**: 3 > 1, so **3/4 > 1/4**
- **2/5** vs **4/5**: 2 < 4, so **2/5 < 4/5**
- **3/8** vs **3/8**: 3 = 3, so **3/8 = 3/8**

**Why this works**: Same denominator means same-sized pieces. More pieces = bigger fraction!

```notes
Here's the good news: when the bottom numbers are the same, comparing is super easy!

Think about it with pizza. If two pizzas are both cut into 8 equal slices, and one person has 3 slices while another has 5 slices, who has more pizza? The person with 5 slices!

So 5/8 is bigger than 3/8.

Just look at the top numbers (numerators) and compare them. The bigger numerator means the bigger fraction!

### Using Pictures to Compare

Drawing can help us see which fraction is bigger:

**Example: Compare 2/4 and 3/4**

```
2/4: [##__]  (2 out of 4 shaded)
3/4: [###_]  (3 out of 4 shaded)
```

We can see that 3/4 has more shaded, so 3/4 > 2/4

```notes
One great strategy is to draw the fractions!

Draw two rectangles or circles the same size. Divide both into the same number of parts (the denominator). Then shade the number of parts shown by the numerator.

Whichever has more shaded is the bigger fraction!

This is especially helpful when you're just learning and want to check your answer.
```

### Comparing to Benchmarks

Some fractions are easy to picture. We can use them as **benchmarks**:

- **0**: Nothing shaded (like 0/4)
- **1/2**: Half shaded (like 2/4 or 4/8)
- **1**: All shaded (like 4/4 or 8/8)

**Is 3/4 closer to 1/2 or to 1?**
- Half of 4 is 2, so 1/2 = 2/4
- 3/4 is more than 2/4, getting close to 4/4
- So 3/4 is closer to 1!

```notes
Benchmarks are fractions we know really well that help us understand other fractions.

Zero, one-half, and one are the most useful benchmarks.

If you're trying to figure out how big 5/8 is, you might think: "Half of 8 is 4, so 4/8 = 1/2. Five-eighths is a little more than half."

This helps you estimate and check if your answers make sense!
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake**: Bigger denominator means bigger fraction

**Wrong thinking**: "8 is bigger than 4, so 1/8 > 1/4"

**Reality**: 1/4 is actually BIGGER than 1/8!

**Why?** When you cut something into MORE pieces, each piece is SMALLER.

- 1/4 means 1 piece when whole is cut into 4
- 1/8 means 1 piece when whole is cut into 8
- The 1/8 pieces are smaller!

```notes
This is a really common mistake, so let's talk about it!

It seems like 1/8 should be bigger than 1/4 because 8 is bigger than 4. But that's backwards!

Think about it: if you cut one pizza into 4 slices and another into 8 slices, which slices are bigger? The pizza cut into 4 has bigger slices!

So 1/4 (one big slice) is more pizza than 1/8 (one small slice).

Remember: more pieces means smaller pieces!
```

### Let's Practice!

Compare these fractions. Use <, >, or =

1. 2/5 ___ 4/5
2. 6/8 ___ 3/8
3. 1/4 ___ 1/4
4. 5/6 ___ 2/6

**Challenge**: Is 3/4 greater than, less than, or equal to 6/8? (Hint: Draw them!)

```notes
Time to practice!

For problems 1-4, remember: same denominator means just compare the numerators.

The challenge problem is trickier! You might want to draw both fractions to see. What do you notice about 3/4 and 6/8? They actually look the same size...

This leads into something we'll learn next: equivalent fractions!

## <a id="activity"></a>Activity: Fraction Comparison Game

**Game: Greater Than, Less Than**

Materials needed: Index cards with fractions written on them

How to play:
1. Shuffle the cards and split them between two players
2. Both players flip over their top card at the same time
3. Compare the fractions — bigger fraction wins both cards
4. If equal, it's a tie (each keeps their own card)
5. Player with the most cards at the end wins!

**Starter fractions**: 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8, 2/8, 4/8, 6/8

```notes
This game is like "War" with playing cards, but with fractions!

For this first version, use fractions with denominators of 4 or 8. These are related (8 = 2 × 4), so students can compare them.

If students get stuck, encourage them to draw the fractions or think about benchmarks.

This is a great way to build fraction fluency through practice!
