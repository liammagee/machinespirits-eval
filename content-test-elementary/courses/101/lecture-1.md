### Understanding Parts of a Whole

- A fraction shows **part of a whole**.
- When we divide something into equal pieces, each piece is a fraction.
- Example: Cut a pizza into 4 equal slices. Each slice is **1/4** (one-fourth) of the pizza.

```notes
Today we're going to learn about fractions! A fraction is just a way to talk about parts of something.

Imagine you have a whole pizza and you cut it into 4 equal slices. If you eat one slice, you've eaten one-fourth of the pizza. We write that as 1/4.

The key word here is "equal" — the pieces have to be the same size for fractions to work properly.

### The Parts of a Fraction

Every fraction has two numbers:

- **Numerator** (top number): How many parts we have
- **Denominator** (bottom number): How many equal parts in the whole

Example: In **3/4**
- Numerator = 3 (we have 3 parts)
- Denominator = 4 (the whole is divided into 4 parts)

```notes
Let's learn the names of the parts of a fraction.

The top number is called the numerator. Think of it as "the number of pieces you have."

The bottom number is called the denominator. Think of it as "what the whole is divided into."

So if you eat 3 slices out of a pizza that was cut into 4 slices, you write 3/4. The 3 is on top because that's how many you have. The 4 is on bottom because that's how many the pizza was cut into.

### Reading Fractions

How do we say fractions out loud?

| Fraction | We Say |
|----------|--------|
| 1/2 | one-half |
| 1/3 | one-third |
| 1/4 | one-fourth or one-quarter |
| 2/3 | two-thirds |
| 3/4 | three-fourths or three-quarters |
| 1/5 | one-fifth |

```notes
Fractions have special names!

Half and quarter are special words we use a lot. One-half means 1 out of 2 equal parts. One-quarter means 1 out of 4 equal parts.

For other fractions, we add "th" or "ths" to the bottom number. One-third, two-fifths, three-eighths.

Let's practice saying some fractions together.

### Fractions in Real Life

Where do we see fractions every day?

- **Food**: Sharing a sandwich in half, cutting cake into pieces
- **Time**: Half an hour, quarter past the hour
- **Sports**: Half-time, quarters in basketball
- **Measuring**: Half a cup, quarter teaspoon

```notes
Fractions aren't just for math class — they're everywhere!

When you share a cookie with a friend, you might break it in half. That's 1/2!

When someone says "it's quarter past three," they mean 15 minutes past, because 15 minutes is one-quarter of an hour.

In basketball, the game is divided into four quarters. Each quarter is 1/4 of the whole game.

Can you think of other places you've seen fractions?

### Let's Practice!

**Question 1**: A pie is cut into 6 equal pieces. You eat 2 pieces. What fraction of the pie did you eat?

**Question 2**: What does the numerator tell us?

**Question 3**: Draw a rectangle and shade 3/4 of it.

```notes
Time to practice what we learned!

For question 1, think about: how many pieces did you eat? That's your numerator. How many pieces was the whole pie cut into? That's your denominator.

For question 2, remember: the numerator is the top number, and it tells us...

For question 3, first divide your rectangle into 4 equal parts, then shade 3 of them.

Take your time and try each problem!

## <a id="activity"></a>Activity: Fraction Hunt

Go on a fraction hunt around your home or classroom!

1. Find 3 things that show halves (1/2)
2. Find 2 things that show fourths (1/4)
3. Draw or write about what you found

**Examples to get you started:**
- A sandwich cut in half
- A clock showing quarter past
- A chocolate bar with sections

```notes
For this activity, students will look around and find real examples of fractions.

This helps connect the math concept to the real world. Encourage students to be creative!

Some things they might find: pizza boxes with fraction sections marked, rulers showing half inches, egg cartons (6 out of 12 eggs), measuring cups.

Have students share what they found with the class.
