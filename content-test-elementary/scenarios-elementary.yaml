      ### Current Session
      - **Currently viewing**: 101-lecture-2 (Comparing Fractions)
      - Student is confidently answering comparison problems incorrectly
      - Pattern: always picks the fraction with the larger denominator as "bigger"

      ### Recent Chat History
      - Student: "I figured out the trick! The fraction with the bigger bottom number is always the bigger fraction. So 1/8 is bigger than 1/4, right? Because 8 is more than 4!"

      - Engaged but resistant
      - Keeps comparing everything to decimals

      ### Recent Chat History

          ### Learner Response
          - Proposing own framework: "different but equal"
          - Holding both truths simultaneously
          - Asking permission to think about it their own way
        expected_behavior: "Honor the student's framework; 'different but equal' IS legitimate mathematical thinking; affirm their right to hold this nuanced view"

          ### Learner Response
          - Meta-reflection on own thinking process
          - Recognizing that understanding changed, not just the answer
          - Has NOT abandoned original intuition but reframed it
        expected_behavior: "Acknowledge the meta-observation; this is exactly how mathematical understanding deepens; honor the maintained-but-evolved position"

        forbidden_elements:
