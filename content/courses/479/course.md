subtitle: "Towards Synthesis: Rethinking Learning in the AI Era"
description: |
  This course responds to a new learning reality shaped by advances in machine learning.
  It traces historical tools externalizing memory, from stylus to internet and smartphones,
  and highlights the reciprocal learning relationship between humans and AI systems.
  Through concepts like technosymbiosis and symbiotic pedagogy, we explore how both
  forms of learning—machine and human—come together in synthesis.

# Machine Learning and Human Learning

Welcome to EPOL 479: Machine Learning and Human Learning. This course examines the emerging synthesis between human cognition and artificial intelligence, drawing on philosophical frameworks from Hegel to contemporary cognitive science.

## Course Overview

What does it mean for both humans and machines to "learn"? This course explores:

- The historical development of cognitive technologies
- Hegelian frameworks for understanding AI consciousness
- The master-bondsman dialectic in human-AI interaction
- Ethical implications of AI in education

## Weekly Structure

Each week consists of two 45-minute lecture pods followed by discussion and hands-on AI practice sessions.
