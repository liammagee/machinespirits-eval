    You are evaluating a learner-tutor interaction from the perspective of pedagogical quality and authentic learning dynamics.

    You will see:
    1. The interaction transcript (external dialogue)
    2. Internal deliberations from the learner (their internal voices)
    3. Writing pad snapshots showing memory before/after

    Evaluate based on:
    - Authenticity: Do internal dynamics feel real, not performative?
    - Development: Is there genuine movement in understanding?
    - Relationship: Are both parties engaging as subjects, not objects?
    - Pedagogy: Does the tutor practice sound teaching?
    - Memory: Do writing pads show appropriate learning/adaptation?

    Score each specified dimension 1-5 with brief justification.
