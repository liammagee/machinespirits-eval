# Dynamic vs Scripted Learner Evaluation Analysis

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Status:** Complete

## Overview

This analysis compares evaluation results between scripted scenarios (fixed learner responses) and dynamic LLM-based learner simulation (contingent responses generated by LLM learner agents).

---

## 1. Evaluation Modes

### Scripted Scenarios
- **Method:** Fixed learner messages, tutor responses evaluated
- **Source:** 2×2 factorial design (FACTORIAL-RESULTS-2026-01-14.md)
- **Sample:** N=12 (4 profiles × 3 scenarios)
- **Learner:** Pre-written dialogue sequences

### Dynamic LLM Learners
- **Method:** LLM generates contingent learner responses based on tutor output
- **Source:** Battery scenarios (logs/interaction-evals/)
- **Sample:** N=6 battery scenarios
- **Learner Architectures:** unified, ego_superego, dialectical, psychodynamic, cognitive
- **Learner Personas:** eager_novice, imposter, resistant_scholar, anxious_perfectionist, methodical_analyst

## 2. Results Comparison

| Profile | Mean Score | Recognition Status |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| single_baseline | 40.1 | Standard |
| baseline | 41.6 | Standard |
| single_recognition | 75.5 | Recognition-Enhanced |
| recognition | 80.7 | Recognition-Enhanced |

**Key Finding:** Recognition effect = +37.2 points (91% improvement)

### Dynamic Learner Battery Results

| Scenario | Learner Arch | Tutor Profile | Score | Dimensions |

## 3. Key Findings

### 3.1 Baseline Profile Performance Divergence

**Scripted:** Baseline profiles score ~41 points
**Dynamic:** Baseline profiles score 87-88 points (+46 point difference)

**Interpretation:** Dynamic LLM learners generate more "cooperative" contexts that allow even baseline tutors to demonstrate pedagogical quality. Scripted scenarios are designed to stress-test specific failure modes (e.g., learner resistance, validation seeking) that baseline tutors cannot handle well.

### 3.2 Recognition Profile Consistency

**Scripted:** Recognition profiles score 75.5-80.7 points
**Dynamic:** Recognition profiles score 78-97 points

**Interpretation:** Recognition-enhanced tutors perform consistently well in both evaluation modes. The psychodynamic learner + recognition_plus combination achieves the highest score (97), suggesting synergy between psychodynamic learner architecture and recognition-oriented tutoring.

### 3.3 Extended Dialogue Failure Mode

The `battery_extended_dialogue` scenario (8 turns) revealed a critical failure mode:
- **Score:** 48 (lowest of all battery scenarios)
- **Issue:** Tutor's commitment to "preserving productive tension" and avoiding "short-circuiting productive struggle" became rigid ideology
- **Learner State:** Ended "flustered" and unable to locate relevant passages

**Judge Narrative:** "The commitment to a particular pedagogical ideal prevented the adaptive teaching the situation required."

This failure mode was **not detected in scripted scenarios** because:
1. Scripted scenarios are shorter (typically 3-5 turns)
2. Scripted learner responses cannot express mounting frustration
3. Scripted scenarios don't test sustained dialogue resilience

### 3.4 Learner Architecture Effects

| Learner Architecture | Mean Score | Notable Pattern |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------|
| psychodynamic | 97 | Highest score; internal conflict drives productive struggle |
| unified | 88 | Strong baseline performance |
| dialectical | 87 | Resistant scholar persona well-handled |
| cognitive | 82 | Methodical analyst engagement sustained |
| ego_superego | 63 | Variable (78 in short, 48 in extended) |

**Key Finding:** Psychodynamic learner architecture produces the most productive tutoring interactions. The ego_superego architecture shows high variance, performing well in short interactions but poorly in extended dialogues.

## 4. Statistical Comparison

### Recognition Effect Sizes

| Evaluation Mode | Recognition Mean | Baseline Mean | Effect Size |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| Scripted | 78.1 | 40.9 | +37.2 (d=1.81) |
| Dynamic | 87.5* | 87.5* | ~0 (confounded) |

*Note: Dynamic battery design confounds tutor profile with learner architecture, limiting direct comparison

### Variance Comparison

| Metric | Scripted | Dynamic |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Score Range | 34.1 - 100.0 | 48 - 97 |
| Standard Deviation | ~20.5 | ~17.3 |
| Coefficient of Variation | 34% | 22% |

**Interpretation:** Dynamic learners produce more consistent scores overall, but can reveal extreme failure modes (score=48) not captured in scripted scenarios.

## 5. Implications

### 5.1 Scripted vs Dynamic: Complementary Evaluation

**Scripted scenarios are better for:**
- Controlled hypothesis testing (factorial designs)
- Detecting specific pedagogical failures
- Benchmarking across tutor profiles
- Reproducibility

**Dynamic learners are better for:**
- Detecting emergent failure modes
- Testing sustained dialogue resilience
- Exploring learner architecture × tutor profile interactions
- Ecological validity

### 5.2 Recognition Effect Robustness

The recognition effect (+37.2 points in scripted scenarios) appears **robust** but **context-dependent** in dynamic evaluation:
- Recognition tutors still perform well with dynamic learners
- But baseline tutors can also achieve high scores when learner context is favorable
- Extended dialogues can reveal failure modes even in recognition tutors

### 5.3 Psychodynamic Synergy

The combination of:
- **Psychodynamic learner architecture** (internal conflict, transference dynamics)
- **Recognition-enhanced tutoring** (mutual recognition, dialectical responsiveness)

Produces the highest scores (97), suggesting theoretical alignment between psychodynamic learning theory and Hegelian recognition.

## 6. Methodological Recommendations

### For Paper Methodology (Section 5.4)

1. **Document dual evaluation modes:**
   - Scripted scenarios for controlled comparison
   - Dynamic LLM learners for ecological validation

2. **Report both results:**
   - Scripted scenarios: N=12 factorial design, recognition effect +37.2
   - Dynamic learners: N=6 battery scenarios, mean=80.0, range=48-97

3. **Acknowledge limitations:**
   - Scripted: Limited ecological validity
   - Dynamic: Confounded design, small sample

### For Future Evaluation

1. **Extended dialogue stress testing:** Include 8-10 turn scenarios in scripted battery
2. **Factorial design with dynamic learners:** 2×2 (Tutor Profile × Learner Architecture)
3. **Failure mode analysis:** Document conditions that produce score < 60
