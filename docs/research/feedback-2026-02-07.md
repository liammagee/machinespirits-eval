Feedback:

1. Provide a bigger introduction to the models and the rationale for selecting them (cost, quality, speed, comparison of weaker to stronger models).
2. Justify choice of Hegel as curriculum in sections 3.1 and 5.2 - part of a course at UIUC on Hegel and AI.
3. Address occasional informal language ("it’s", p.3; "we're, p. 13).
4. Make images larger (text is illegible)
5. When introducing the '"Big Five" personality framework ', also discuss other studies that talk about Freud in the context of AI (e.g. Magee et al., "Structured like a Language Model", many others)
6. In the introduction, describe the structure of the paper, and in the conclusion, summarize that structure.
7. Introduce the 'base' prompt, and more clearly distinguish 'enhanced' and 'action' variants - this is confusing.
8. p. 5, 2.1: Discuss work more recent than 2014.
9. p. 6 (and elsewhere) The "ghosts" reference is a bit too removed. Can we cite Andrej Karpathy's blog post: https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/animals-vs-ghosts/ to corroborate? (Add it to bibtex)
10. p. 7: we only cite one Anthropic paper. They've had a lot to say on this.
11. p. 9: Hegel dialectic terminates abruptly. How does Hegel think self-consciousness can still emerge through this impasse?
12. p. 9: "Architectural features that approximate the functional benefits of recognition—engagement with learner interpretations, honoring productive struggle, repair mechanisms" - incomplete sentence.
13. pp. 10, 13, and throughout - hyphens not converted to proper Latex lists. whitespace issue?
14. p. 12 - why "Irrational superego"? The Magee et al. "Structured" paper could be justification for ignoring the "id" - already baked in to the model.
15. p. 13 cite key references on GAN (Goodfellow et al. 2014), and other related models.
16. p.15, 4.1 do we actually do AI-powered dialectical negotiation. 
17. p. 18: "(r=0.55, N=88)... ratio=0.87" - what is the ratio? make it clear.
18. p. 19: check the justification on memory and recognition and justify choice of models and configurations.
19. p. 21: "This discrepancy means the multi-agent synergy finding should be treated as exploratory and model-specific rather than a robust general result." how would we test this further?
20. p. 21: "We conducted complementary analyses:" - explain why
21. p. 21: "some early runs used Claude Sonnet 4.5 via OpenRouter directly" - still true?
22. p. 21: Describe somewhere the pipeline for producing and judging the data. By this point it looks obscure.
23. p. 22: explain why "Total Attempts" and "Scored" might differ. what are typical causes of failure?
24. p. 24: "Kimi exhibited particularly severe ceiling effects, assigning the maximum score (5/5) on actionability for *every* response, resulting in zero variance on that dimension" - this raises questions about the judge prompts. Do we describe these anywhere?
25. p. 25: "Base vs Enhanced..." - as noted earlier, we need clear explanation about enhanced vs active control. Do both add value? p. 27 describes "Post-hoc active control", but unclear why both need to exist.
26. p. 27: "Model confound and fair comparison". This sounds like we avoided tests that we should have run - but that's not clear either. Can we explain this better to sound less defensive? Or do we actually need more tests?
27. p. 27: Should the design note come earlier? Similar to the point above, the active control / enhanced discussion seems like two competing concepts, and their respective rationales get lost. 
28. p. 29: Can we rename unified / psycho to Single / Multi (like the Tutor) for consistency?
29. p. 29: "†Cells 6 and 8 re-scored with updated rubric (14 dimensions including dialogue transcript context; see Section 5.1). Original scores were 83.4 and 86.7; the change is minimal (+0.5, +0.6)." is this true aeven with the latest evals?
30. p. 33: "**Practical Implication**: The multi-agent synergy for recognition prompts remains a plausible hypothesis but should not inform design decisions until replicated. For systems using only improved instructions (enhanced), multi-agent architecture is unnecessary overhead across all models tested." In a todo note, say how this test could be done
31. p. 33: "(suggesting "479-lecture-1" to 4th graders learning fractions)" - its still unclear how/why this happens. Add to the todos a note to investigate further. Same pointed is repeated elsewhere (p. 35). **Critical we investigate this - training is not the issue. Sounds like course data isolation could be compromised.**
32. p. 36: "phronesis" comes out of the blue. What is it, why does it differ from rule-based reasoning?
33. p. 42: Can we instead use Claude Code rather than or as well as regex to do thematic analysis? Add this to todos.
34. p. 44: Table 44, comparing 3 runs, is unclear - spell out the shifts between runs.
35. p. 48: as noted above, the models are not "trained" on curriculum content - so this advice suggests data leaks across tasks.
36. p. 48: spell out what cells 6 and 8 are and why they are compared.
37. p. 49: like the master-slave dialectic above, section 7.1 stops without acknowledging how the dialectical impasse is overcome.
38. p. 49: "This finding should be treated as a hypothesis for future investigation rather than an established result." Add to the todo list how this would be investigated and evaluated.
39. p. 50: "For concrete procedural content (fractions), the relational depth recognition enables may be less relevant. Correct procedure matters more than mutual transformation. The learner's identity isn't at stake in the same way." Does this point relate to Hegel's ideas of the development of self-consciousness?
40. p. 50: "The domain transfer findings reveal an unexpected role for the Superego: reality testing." double-check results, and cross-check with Freudian theory.
41. p. 50: "The content domain differs from training data" - as noted above, models are not trained
42. p. 51: "This asymmetry between what the architecture affects (learner turn quality) and what the rubric measures (tutor response quality) suggests that Factor C's contribution may be underestimated by our current evaluation design." - add a note in the todos on how we might fix this
43. p. 51: "AI personality research typically treats personality as dispositional—stable traits the system exhibits. Our framework suggests personality is better understood relationally." discuss this in relation to the idea of strategic anthropomorphism.
44. p. 53: "2. **For new domains or domain transfer**: Multi-agent architecture is essential. The Superego catches hallucinated content from training—without it, the tutor may suggest philosophy lectures to elementary students. The +9.9 point improvement justifies the latency cost." As noted above, double-check this.
45. p. 54: "The thematic coding is regex-based" - as noted above, consider AI as well as regex theme extraction.
46. p. 55: "A critical model confound limits its interpretability: the active control ran on Nemotron while the factorial base and recognition conditions used Kimi K2.5, and Nemotron scores substantially lower than Kimi across all conditions." Discussed above - can we address this issue?
47. p. 57: "Domain generalizability" - noted above, double-check results and analysis.
48. p. 58: "domain confusion" - again, double-check this. 
49. p. 58: Move Appendix E to the end of the paper.
