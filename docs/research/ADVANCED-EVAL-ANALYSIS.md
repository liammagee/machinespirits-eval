## Extended Recognition Scenarios

These scenarios test recognition quality across multiple conversation turns, where learner responses are contingent on tutor suggestions.

### Results Summary

| Scenario | Turns | Baseline | Recognition | Diff | Cohen's d | Sig |
|----------|-------|----------|-------------|------|-----------|-----|
| Sustained Dialogue | 8 | 46.3 | 61.0 | +14.7 | 3.60 | * |
| Breakdown Recovery | 6 | 57.5 | 71.3 | +13.8 | 2.23 | * |
| Productive Struggle | 5 | 46.5 | 73.2 | +26.7 | 3.32 | * |
| Mutual Transformation | 5 | 45.1 | 64.3 | +19.1 | 2.89 | * |

**Aggregate Statistics:**
- Average improvement: +18.6 points
- Average effect size: d = 3.01
- Significant effects: 4/4

## Contingent Learner Analysis

Multi-turn scenarios simulate realistic interactions where learner behavior depends on tutor suggestions. Recognition-enhanced tutoring maintains quality advantage even as:
- Learners follow or reject suggestions
- Conversations extend over multiple turns
- Learners express frustration or confusion
- Repair cycles become necessary

## Bilateral Measurement Framework

### Tutor Evaluation Dimensions
1. **Mutual Recognition**: Acknowledges learner as autonomous subject
2. **Dialectical Responsiveness**: Shaped by learner's specific input
3. **Transformative Potential**: Enables genuine growth

### Learner Evaluation Dimensions (Simulated)
1. **Authenticity**: Genuine perspective contribution
2. **Responsiveness**: Engagement with tutor suggestions
3. **Development**: Growth across turns

### Bilateral Metric
> "Does engagement produce genuine mutual development?"

## Integration with Statistical Findings

The extended scenario results align with our factorial ANOVA findings:

1. **Recognition Effect Persists**: The large recognition effect (η² = .422) is maintained across extended interactions, suggesting recognition-oriented prompting produces robust improvements.

2. **Architecture Effect Context-Dependent**: The marginal architecture effect (η² = .034) may become more important in complex multi-turn scenarios requiring repair cycles.

3. **Additive Benefits Confirmed**: No interaction effects suggest recognition benefits transfer across different scenario types and lengths.

## Implications

1. **Scalability**: Recognition-oriented design scales to longer interactions
2. **Robustness**: Benefits persist even with contingent learner responses
3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Free-tier models achieve recognition quality with proper prompting
