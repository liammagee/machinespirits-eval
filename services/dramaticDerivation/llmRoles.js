/**
 * LLM-backed role bridges for the staging loop (notes/dramatic-derivation-plan.md
 * §2.2, §3 steps 3–4). Each bridge satisfies the engine's role contract
 * (engine.js header) by prompting through llmClient's mock/real seam.
 *
 * Three disciplines are load-bearing here:
 *
 * 1. RELEASES ARE HARNESS-ENFORCED. The frozen schedule decides what is
 *    released, when, and by whom; the bridge looks the cue up and sets
 *    `release` itself. The model only supplies the dramatic prose that
 *    carries the evidence on stage. A model cannot leak through the formal
 *    channel because it never controls the formal channel.
 *
 * 2. THE LEARNER FACTORY TAKES NO WORLD. Same rule as mockRoles: the learner
 *    is built from K_L material only (setting + voice — exactly the fields
 *    the underivability screen screened) and acts on its per-turn view. Its
 *    moves are index-mapped: it adopts from an enumerated exhibit list
 *    (released ∪ background, not yet grounded) and answers the public
 *    question by BINDING its pattern variable — it cannot inject arbitrary
 *    facts into the success channel.
 *
 * 3. MOCK AND REAL SHARE ONE PATH. The bridge always computes the mock's
 *    meta hints (from view-visible material only) and always parses the same
 *    JSON shapes, so a mock run exercises every line the real run will use.
